# Dark Matter Nucleus Capture Simulation
# 10/17/2024
# Jackson Benz, Professor Joshua Berger, Ethan Rutledge
# 
# This code randomly generates dark matter particles propagating through the DUNE far detector.
#      The inverse CDF method is used to randomly determine how many interactions occur between
#      the DM and the LAr in DUNE's FD. An interaction between the DM and LAr is then treated
#      as radiative nucleus capture, and the emitted photons from an Ar nucleus falling into
#      the DM's potential well are generated and tracked using Professor Berger's cross section-
#      calculating code.
#
# Updates:
# 10/17/2024: Added a graph to show the behavior of cross section.
#
# 10/24/2024: Time behavior of calculating cross section calculated and plotted.
#
# 11/07/2024: Begin simulation of the photon decay and nucleus capture as a whole.
#     Approximations in place:
#          Not boosting for the photon generation; I'm assuming that the difference between
#               center of momentum and lab frame is small and won't deflect photons much.
#          I am assuming the photons decay nearly instantly, so I do not need to propagate the
#               dark matter while decay occurs. This allows me to generate the locations of
#               interaction first and then generate photons afterward, which is convenient.
